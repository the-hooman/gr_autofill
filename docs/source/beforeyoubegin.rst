* You can also upload *another* document for checking after you’ve started editing. Simply use these options:

   :scale: 30%

* Another option for importing existing text is to create a blank document, then paste in text from your clipboard.

.. admonition:: Note: 

   If you use this option, your document’s original formatting will be lost.
