   Any resemblance to actual products and features is merely coincidental.

From your greeting to your closing (and common phrases in between), Grammarly Hint suggests complete sentences in your docs so that you can draft them with ease. Because it operates in the background, you can write a doc like you normally would, and Grammarly Hint will offer suggestions as you type. When you see a suggestion that you like, click the “tab” button to use it.

Grammarly Hint helps save you time by cutting back on repetitive writing, while reducing the chance of spelling and grammatical errors. It can even suggest relevant contextual phrases. For example, if it's Friday it may suggest "Have a great weekend!" as a closing phrase. 
The feature :ref:`utilizes machine learning <science>` to give you better responses the more you use it. So if you're more of a “thanks!” than a “thanks.” person, we'll suggest the response that's, well, more you!

In order to begin using the Grammarly Hint feature, user needs to :ref:`create a new document <createadoc>`.
